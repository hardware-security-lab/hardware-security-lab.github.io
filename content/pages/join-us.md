# Join Us

We have research opportunities for undergraduate, MS, and PhD students at Georgia Institute of Technology. If you're not yet here, include "Daniel Genkin" in your application.

## Undergraduates

We recommend taking a class in computer security, systems, cryptography, or architecture. Successful undergraduates usually spend 10-20 hours a week if they want good progress. Prior experience is not required, but curiosity in problem-solving and persistence is something we look for, since failure (e.g. bugs, errors, and negative results) is a constant companion in research. You need to enjoy getting frustrated by problems.

## MS and PhD Students

Please read a hardware security paper from the past 5 years from a top-tier venue and be willing to discuss limitations, opportunities, and future work you might be interested in carrying out.

Drop us a line at <a href="mailto://genkin@gatech.edu">genkin@gatech.edu</a> if you're interested in working with us.
